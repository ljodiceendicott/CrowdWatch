The Solution for your business' counting of customer needs

As a Buisness,
You are able to take full advantage of the data analytics.
The data will be formatted into a spreadsheet format that can be 
easily read by a person as well as incorporating graphics.
It is something that only the business itself will be able to see 
and use as a tool to understand the times and locations for the business
as well as making sure that there is proper staffing to help midigate the 
problem when there is either too much or not enough staff for particular times
This portion of analytics will look at the historical data for the amount of

As a customer,
There is a web-interface that is usable to help them understand
