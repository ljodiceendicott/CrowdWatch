# Inventory-System
  The project is an inventory aid system. It will help out people that are looking to keep track of the different things that they own. It will allow people to have a tool that lets people know the amount of items they have. By knowing what people have, it will most likely help people save money as well as reduce waste. The idea is if they know they have it, they dont need to go out and buy something again. They will also know when there is an item that is out of stock because those items will be notified. With this system in place you can also set macros later to reorder items. If someone would be inclined to do this.

This Project fulfills my Senior thesis for Endicott College.
