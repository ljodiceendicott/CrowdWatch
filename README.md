# PeopleWatch
Knowing the amount of people in a specific area is something that is very important. It can be used to help aid in keeping an area safely under its maximum occupancy. It can also help learn about what times are more likely to be busy and inform companies when more staff would be needed while also informing clients the times to go when it will be less busy. With the solution of PeopleWatcher, it gives the analytics real time to help in these sort of situations. By allowing the information to be public to clients and businesses, it allows for companies to use data that they have been able to collect to help adjust their own processes to improve their own infrastructure. An example of a place where this could be used is on public transportation. This can be seen due to the fact that there are times during the day where there are areas that the transportation can be seen as at maximum capacity. This sort of problem could be solved by increasing the amount of transportation to these locations and knowing where this is needed could be found with PeopleWatcher. 
 

This Project fulfills my Senior thesis for Endicott College.
  it encorporates:
  - Arduino
  - Python
  - HTML/CSS & Javascript
  - SQL 
  - Spreadsheet Files
  
To Run this project (Website) use the command:
Command has to be ran from ' Senior Thesis\Website\PeopleWatchSite '

' node index.js '

Before running the project for non-testing usage you will have to run the python command:
' python getStarted.py '
	This command will be used to create the data storage for the project. this includes:
	- SQL Database file -- all information that is collected by the system is found in this file
	- MongoDB Database file -- log of the actions from the website 
	- Spreadsheet file -- (for business usage for analytics)
	- description.json -- used in the creation of the layout includes the constants for each location
