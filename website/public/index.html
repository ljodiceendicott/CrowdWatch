      <h3>What is PeopleWatch?</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing the amount of people in a specific area is something that is
        very important. It can be used to help aid in keeping an area safely
        under its maximum occupancy. It can also help learn about what times are
        more likely to be busy and inform companies when more staff would be
        needed while also informing clients the times to go when it will be less
        busy. With the solution of PeopleWatcher, it gives the analytics real
        time to help in these sort of situations. By allowing the information to
        be public to clients and businesses, it allows for companies to use data
        that they have been able to collect to help adjust their own processes
        to improve their own infrastructure. An example of a place where this
        could be used is on public transportation. This can be seen due to the
        fact that there are times during the day where there are areas that the
        transportation can be seen as at maximum capacity. This sort of problem
        could be solved by increasing the amount of transportation to these
        locations and knowing where this is needed could be found with
        PeopleWatcher.
